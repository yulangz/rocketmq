As we know, Oracle provides Support on Oracle Java SE products in the Oracle Lifetime Support Policy. For product releases after Java SE 8, Oracle will designate a release, every three years, as a Long-Term-Support (LTS) release. Java SE 11 is an LTS release. For the purposes of Oracle Premier Support, non‑LTS releases are considered a cumulative set of implementation enhancements of the most recent LTS release. Once a new feature release is made available, any previous non‑LTS release will be considered superseded. For example, Java SE 9 was a non‑LTS release and immediately superseded by Java SE 10 (also non‑LTS), Java SE 10 in turn is immediately superseded by Java SE 11. Java SE 11 however is an LTS release, and therefore Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support and periodic update releases, even though Java SE 12 was released, details could see from here[1]

In addition, due to the recent COVID-19 epidemic, our 4.8.0 release has been delayed, which has seriously affected community planning. Therefore, we propose a lifecycle release and support plan to support our growing number of cloud customers with faster and stable iterations.
