Goals
-------------

### Generating changelog
We use these three sections in the changelog: new features, bug fixes, improvements.
This list could be generated by the script when doing a release. Along with links to related commits.
Of course, you can edit this change log before the actual release, but it could generate the skeleton.

List of all subjects (first lines in commit message) since last release:
> git log <last tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s

Bug fixes in this release
> git log <last release> HEAD --grep fix

New features in this release
> git log <last release> HEAD --grep rip


### Recognizing unimportant commits

These are formatting changes (adding/removing spaces/empty lines, indentation), missing semicolons, comments. So when you are looking for some change, you can ignore these commits - no logic change inside this commit.

When bisecting, you can ignore these by:
> git bisect skip $(git rev-list --grep irrelevant <good place> HEAD)


### Browsing history

This would add kinda “context” information.
Look at these messages (taken from last few RocketMQ’s commits):

`Deprecated related core pull consumer classes`

`Polish lite pull consumer and fix bug (#1402)`

`Polish LitePullConsumer (#1395)`

`Deprecated the DefaulteMQPull consumer (#1387)`

`Polish lite pull consumer (#1381)`

All of these messages try to specify where is the change. But they don’t share any convention... Are you able to guess what’s inside? These messages miss place specification... So maybe something like parts of the code: docs, remoting, storage, log, …

I know, you can find this information by checking which files had been changed, but that’s slow. 


Format of the commit message
-------------

`<type>(<scope>): <subject>` -- message header

`<blank line>`

`<body>` -- message body

`<blank line>`

`<footer>` -- message footer

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 102 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools.

A commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer, separated by a blank line.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, its header should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `These reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.


### Message Header

The message header is a single line that contains a succinct description of the change containing a type, an optional scope and a subject.

#### Allowed type
This describes the kind of change that this commit is providing.

`rip(feature)`

`fix(bug)`

`docs(documentation)`

`style(formatting, missing semicolons, …)`

`refactor(function)`

`test(adding missing tests)`

`chore(maintain)`

#### Allowed scope

A scope can be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example log, remoting, rpc, client, console, plugin, storage, etc...

You can use * if there isn't a more fitting scope.

#### subject text
This is a very short description of the change.

> Use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”.

> Don't capitalize the first letter.

> No dot (.) at the end

### Message body
just as in <subject> use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
includes motivation for the change and contrasts with the previous behaviour.

### Message footer

Closed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:

> Closes #234

or in case of multiple issues:

> Closes #123, #245, #992


Examples
-------------


> rip(client): simplify pull consumer implementation

  - add assign and seek method
  - add fetchMessageQueues and offsetForTimestamp method

This change simplifies the streaming usage of the pull consumer. 

> fix(rpc): polish 'No route info of this topic' exception

This PR polish exception of 'no route info of this topic'. It will throw more specific exceptions to users. For example, due to network problems, the route data fails to be obtained, and the wrapped remotingXXXXXException is directly thrown to users and users can locate the problem according to exception chaining.

Closes #504

> docs(guide): update the developer guide

A couple of typos fixed:
- indentation
- transaction -> transactional
- start periodic checking
- missing brace
