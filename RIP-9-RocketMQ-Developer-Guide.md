# Background & Motivation

We plan to provide RocketMQ developer guide, including concepts, architecture, functional features, design, samples, best practices, operations, and maintenance management.
## To what degree should we solve the problem?
Give developers a better understanding of the architecture and principles of RocketMQ.
Introduce RocketMQ best practices to developers.

# Non-Goals
Are there any limits to this proposal?
Developer's Guide only supports Chinese and English

# Changes
We will add a new module named docsï¼Œwhich includes CN and EN.
