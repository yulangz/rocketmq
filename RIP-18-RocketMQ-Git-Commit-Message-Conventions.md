Goals
-------------

### Changelog
We use these three sections in the changelog: new features, bug fixes, improvements.
This list could be generated by the script when doing a release. Along with links to related commits.
Of course, you can edit this change log before the actual release, but it could generate the skeleton.

List of all subjects (first lines in commit message) since last release:
> git log <last tag> HEAD --pretty=format:%s

New features in this release
> git log <last release> HEAD --grep ISSUE
