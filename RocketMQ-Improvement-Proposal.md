In the last few years, we use the [Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ)(migrated to Issues) to trace issue or collect new idea from the community. Itâ€™s a nice way for a feature request but not very formal and easy to trace and manage. So We introduce the RIP(RocketMQ Improvement Proposal) mechanism to replace the current Feature Request Process. 

RIPs should be used for significant user-facing or cross-cutting changes, not small incremental improvements. When in doubt, if a committer thinks a change needs an RIP, it does. 

It is easy to start a RIP from sending proposals to dev mail lists. And the whole procedure of a RIP may follow below [RIP Template]().
